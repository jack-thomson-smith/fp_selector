Welcome to FP Selector! 
This application chooses the best fluorescent proteins for you to use
based off of spectral overlap, quantum yield, size, and other factors.
It's coded in python and uses the FPBase REST API to get data.

PLAN (fp_selector is a WIP): 

modules to use: Tkinter, Requests, MatplotLib, 
_
-User picks how many proteins they want
-User picks further critera (qy, price, etc.)
-the program generates the proteins it thinks fit user specifications.
-the program generates links to the papers behind the proteins, and to the 
proteins' graphs on FPBase (ex: https://www.fpbase.org/protein/mazamigreen/).

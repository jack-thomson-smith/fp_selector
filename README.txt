Welcome to FP Selector! 
This application chooses the best fluorescent proteins for you to use
based off of spectral overlap, quantum yield, size, and other factors.
It's coded in python and uses the FPBase REST API to get data.

PLAN:

modules to use: Tkinter, Requests, MatplotLib, 
You pick how many proteins you want.
You pick further critera (qy, price, etc.)

the program generates you the proteins it thinks fit your specifications.
the program generates links to the papers behind the proteins, and to the 
proteins' graphs on FPPicker (ex: https://www.fpbase.org/protein/mazamigreen/).
